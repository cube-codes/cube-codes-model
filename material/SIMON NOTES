@Lukas: 	

* I dont understand the error in PermutationCubeState.equals

* Note: I needed (for orbit) the "usual" solution condition, so (as I think you intended) I converted your CubeSolutionCondition into an interface and implemented a StrictCubeSolutionCondition and a ColorCubeSolutionCondition in the same file.  
Now I dont understand anymore why we separate CubeSpecification and CubeSolutionCondition. Is this fine?

* In ColorCubeLanguage there are in the end three little routines that probably can go in a single line inthe respective code above

Simon 

CubeSolutionCondition: Need (for permutation) the weaker cubeSolutionCondition where face orientations are irrelevant. 

PermutationCubeState: Use permutation library instead of array and self-programmed sgn

PermutationCubeState: Define a scientific source for (or invent) cubelet numbering and orientation vectors 

Orientation: Give an identification with the symmetric group S4
