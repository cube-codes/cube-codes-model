/**
 * History holding all changes to one specific {@link Cube}
 * 
 * Each {@link CubeHistoryChange} describes a recorded change of the {@link CubeState}. They are kept in an ordered list and the first {@link CubeHistoryChange} (position = 0) describes the change away from the initial {@link CubeState} when the history was created, while position = -1 stands for this initial state.
 * As it is possible to move around within the history, the current position denotes the index within the list of the {@link CubeHistoryChange} that lead to the current {@link CubeState}.
 * While moving around changes this current position, the specified {@link Cube} is updated accordingly. E.g. moving backwards will play the inverse of possible {@link CubeMove}s of the {@link CubeHistoryChange}s on the {@link Cube}, too.
 * 
 * The history can be cleaned either from the beginning up to a position or from one on until the end.
 * 
 * Beeing a simple list of {@link CubeHistoryChange}s the history cannot keep multiple different branches. That's why before a new {@link CubeHistoryChange} is recorded while the current position is not at the end of the list, the old future has to be removed/cleaned.
 * 
 * As the history must differentiate changes of the {@link CubeState} that are based on moves within the history on the one side and real new changes to be recorded on the other side, the history sets a number-property 'history' in the 'source' parameter of the {@link Cube}'s commands (denoting the jump in the list) to tell apart these two cases when listening to changes of the {@link CubeState}.
